Gibbon is still alpha software.  It is usable to a certain extent but there 
are a wealth of known bugs and missing features.

Your feedback, especially bug reports, feature requests, and other
suggestions for improvement are welcome.  Please use the web interface
at https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=gibbon for that purpose (select
“Bugs” from the little menu at the top, and then “Submit”).  But please
have a little patience.  Due to lack of man power, it may take some time until
your issue will be resolved.

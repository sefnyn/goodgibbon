A Gtk frontend for FIBS.

More information about the program can be found at 
http://guido-flohr.net/projects/gibbon.

You can get the sources from git://guido-flohr.net/c/gibbon.git.  Check
http://git-scm.org/ if you don't know how to access git:// URLs.

Building the sources is pretty straightforward:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

You don't have to install gibbon in order to test it.  But it will fail
to load the UI definitions and the board definition file in the system
default location unless you point it to the corresponding ressources
in the source directory:

    src/gibbon --data-dir=./data --pixmaps-dir=./pixmaps

Have fun!!

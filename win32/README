This directory contains stuff needed to build an executable installer
image for Windows.

The Windows port of Gibbon is currently maintained by yours truly,
Guido Flohr (guido@imperia.net).  I am far from being an expert for
this task.  You can contribute to Gibbon by taking over maintainership
for this subdirectory of Gibbon.

In order to build an executable installer image ("setup.exe") you
have to do the following:

1) Build the program the regular way with the old story of autoconfiscated
   software:

        ./configure
        make
        make check
        make install

   You need MinGW for this.  Additionally you have to installer Gtk+
   (http://www.gtk.org/) including all dependencies and developer files 
   and SQLite3 (http://www.sqlite.org/).  I had to build and install
   SQLite by hand.  Contact me if you have problems with that.

   If you have checked out the sources via Git, you must first run
   the script "autogen.sh".  That will compile "configure" and set up
   the other missing stuff.  Running "autogen.sh" will probably fail
   if your version of Glib is older than 2.28.8 because the m4 macro
   definitions for GLIB_GSETTINGS are missing.

1a) Read 1) above again! Did you remember to run "make install"
    before you can build a (new) installer?

2) Try everything out by running Gibbon from a command prompt.

3) Download Inno Setup, a software designed for creating executable
   installers.  The web page of Inno Setup is
   http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php.

4) Either the Inno Setup compiler (ISCC.exe) must be in your PATH
   or you have to create a file build-installer.sh.include in
   this directory.  The file must set the shell variable "ISCC" to
   the complete path name of that program.  For example:

        ISCC="/c/Program Files (x86)/Inno Setup 5/ISCC.exe"

   The file will be sourced if present by the script that builds the
   installer.

5) Inspect the build script "build-installer.sh".  It makes several
   assumptions about your setup:

   - MinGW must be installed in C:\MinGW (translated to "/c/MinGW").
   - all libraries (Gtk+, SQLite, ...) must be installed with the
     same prefix (run their configure script with --prefix=/c/MinGW)
   - Gibbon must be installed also be installed to "/c/MinGW"

   If your setup differs, you can play around with the variables
   "mingw_prefix" and "gibbon_prefix" and override them in
   "build-installer.sh.include" (see above for the path to ISCC.exe).

6) Run the script "build-installer.sh".  It must be run from _this_ (!)
   directory.  If you plan to build installers for Gibbon on a
   regular basis you should consider re-writing the script.

Send your questions to me (Guido Flohr <guido@imperia.net>).

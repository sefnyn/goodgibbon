<p>
      SGF as a file format has a number of inherent problems that you
      should be aware of.
    </p>
<p>
      Most games are organized in matches, where each match consists
      of a number of rounds (or games).  It is pretty straightforward
      to represent such a match in SGF.  But you need additional,
      not explicitely defined conventions for going the other way round,
      i.e. for retrieve all information about a match from SGF.
    </p>
<p>
      The convention for a match would be: The SGF file as a whole
      represents the match.  Each game tree in this match represents
      a game (round).  Within each game tree, the first node is the 
      root node used only for meta information, and all subsequent
      nodes represent all moves in this round.
    </p>
<p>
      Another problem is the character set encoding.  As a matter of
      fact, you can only encode SGF in character sets that are supersets
      of US-ASCII.  This library therefore enforces UTF-8 for the
      character set, and automatically converts the file for you.
    </p>
<p>
      For example wide character sets like UCS-2 or UCS-4 are simply
      impossible to code safely.  First of all, the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/" target="_top">SGF specification</a>
      explicitely states that US-ASCII must be used for property
      identifiers.  But UCS-2, or UCS-4 are not supersets of US-ASCII.
    </p>
<p>
      Another problem arises from the fact that an SGF file can mix
      game trees encoded in different character sets.  However, the
      specs allow whitespace between game trees, and the encoding
      of such whitespace is undefined, because the character set
      used is specified inside of the game tree.
    </p>
<p>
      On the other hand, SGF is usable as a portable exchange format
      for a multitude of board games.  But before using it, you should
      inform yourself about the conventions used for that game.  Otherwise
      you can easily run into compatibility issues.
